## Introduction to Shiny

Shiny is a package that allows you to build interactive web applications with th R programming language.

The applications created with `Shiny` can be manipulated and shared online

```{r}
library(shiny)
```

In order to open Shiny, you:

1.  First, need to click on 'RStudio IDE' on the the Data Scientist Workbench. This will open RStudio.

6.  When you create a project, you will get 2 R files by default: ui.R, and server.R

-   ui.R: is the user interface script. It's used to create the layout and appearance of the app, including the graphs, slider bars and text boxes.

-   server.R: contains instructions for building your output object.

The inputs come from ui.R, so when you update the input in ui.R, the output in server.R will be automatically updated.

In each separate project you create, you should run the 'library' function at the beginning of booth the ui.,R and server.R sessions.

7.  When you click 'Run App' you will see a drop down menu with three options

-   The default 'Run in Window' option will open a new window to run the app. You may need to disable pop-up blocking software for this method.

-   The 'Run in Viewer Pane' option will show the app in the fourth window under the 'viewer tab'

-   The 'run external' option will open a new tab for the application

Before you run the app, you need to make sure that the previous app has stooped
